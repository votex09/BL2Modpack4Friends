Weapon Manufacturer Changes
  Standardizes Dahl burst count among common weapons to reduce part dependency and buffs underperforming gun types.
  Gives all Hyperion common weapons and some uniques a 10% multiplicative crit damage buff. Excludes the Bitch, the Bane, the Lady Fist, the Fibber (Only affects the Shotgun barrel), the Interfacer, and the Conference call. Red text weapons do not reflect this on their card.
  Improves competitiveness of several Jakobs guns. Gives assault rifles full-auto. Hammerlock guns now sport perfect accuracy, high crit bonuses, and DPS similar to a full Jakobs Muckamuck to give them a unified Sniper theme.
  All Maliwan products excluding Sniper Rifles receive quality of life changes or in the case of rocket launchers, a substantial redesign.
  Improved Maliwan pistol fire rate and clip size.
  Rebalances several guns in the Vladof brand to make them more competitive or more reasonable.
  All Tediore weapons have received a redesign and combat tweaks. In addition to improving general combat usage of all four weapon types, all Tediore products (including grenades and rocket launchers) now innately have ammo regeneration that scales with rarity thanks to Tediore's digistruct technology. (Thank you to Aaron0000 for permission to incorporate Tediore REGENdaries.)
  Lots of small Torgue changes. Double Projectile speed, Explosion Radius for Pistols. Legendary Weapon improvements.
Spiker Weapons
  Redesigns Spikers (E-Tech pistols) into hand-held micro-rocket launchers. All spikers deal heavily increased damage, explode sooner, and now deal your choice of Reaper, Grenade, or Rocket (vanilla) splash.
  To compensate for this dramatic increase in damage, Bandit, Dahl, and Vladof Spikers have higher recoil, higher burst delay, and lower fire rate (respectively) to keep them in line with other brands while retaining their brand signature.
  Additionally, Maliwan spikers have massively increased elemental chance and damage at the expense of lower DPS.
Dart Weapons
  Replaces Darts with Laser Pistols, which have 25% additive critical damage, pierce enemies, and bounce off surfaces once (twice if Hyperion).
    Dahl: Shotgun mode when ADS
    Hyperion: Extra surface bounce. Also extra crit when combined with Gear Overhaul
    Maliwan: High DoT chance and damage
    Bandit: Extra shot chance when combined with Gear Overhaul
    Vladof: It fires fast I guess
    Tediore: Regenerates ammo when combined with Gear overhaul
Relics (Incoming wall of text)
  Massively buffs the statistics of Aggression relics to allow them to compete with similar relics.
  Dramatically increased the potency of Proficiency relics to compete with Bones of the Ancients.
  Redesigns the Might of the Seraphs to increase reload speed and fire rate with all weapons. Also increases movement speed. Requires UCP.
  Stockpile relics now add an absolute value of ammo, increasing usefulness at all points of gameplay. Additionally, all Stockpile relics now provide an enormous upgrade over Blood of the Ancients' ammo pools.
  Blood of the Ancients now add an absolute value of ammo. Additionally, all now provide more ammo than you could have gotten with a max quality percent-based one for a net upgrade to all ammo pools.
  Note: To get the final 'even' numbers, fractional bullets are granted at some upgrade levels. Your stockpile relic or Blood of the Ancients may grant unusual numbers below maximum quality.
  AngrierPat redesigned the Friendship Amulet to grant all team members (including yourself) +10% damage, maximum and minimum accuracy, weapon spread, reload speed, and magazine size, stacking with itself up to +40% to all stats.
  Increases the effectiveness of Elemental relics to allow them to compete with Bones of the Ancients.
  Changes Allegiance relics so blue and purple Allegiance relics often have all three attributes instead of two randomly selected ones.
  WARNING: Violates Sanity check. Probably deletes all existing Allegiance relics. Do not load affected save files without activating this mod first. Check included Gibbed codes.
Relics (CONTD)
Increases the effectiveness of Protection relics to 71% shield capacity/recharge rate and adds 44.5% recharge delay at maximum quality to compete with Skin of the Ancients.
  Resistance relics now spawn with standardized resistance percents, now also grants resistance to dot elemental damage, and reduces your chance to be affected by dots (in addition to resisting impact damage).
  The Bone of the Ancients now comes in Explosive, Slag, and Melee/Melee Override Cooldown. Framework coded by SirUmnei and used/altered with permission.
  WARNING: Violates Sanity check. Deletes all existing Bones of the Ancients. Do not load affected save files without activating this mod first. Check included Gibbed codes.
  Skin of the Ancients now spawns with standardized resistance percents, now also grants resistance to dot elemental damage and reduces your chance to be affected by dots (in addition to resisting impact damage) and now always spawns with all three shield stats.
  WARNING: Violates Sanity check. Probably deletes all existing Skins of the Ancients. Do not load affected save files without activating this mod first.
  To adjust existing Skins of the Ancients, use Gibbed to change the BetaPart to Effect7. No other parts may have Effect7.
  Redesigns the Blood of the Seraphs to subtract a large portion of health in exchange for a very large chunk of constantly active health regeneration. Thank you to AngrierPat for the idea.
  Tenacity, Vitality, and Heart of the Ancients relics have optional vanilla-style changes or Aaron0000's Agility Relic designs incorporated.
  Krieg and Salvador have MASSIVE Skill changes, too many to list.
  Anarchy Stacks differently
  Zer0 has his melee skills buffed by a significant margin
  Lots of stat based changes to All characters

  30% increased experience gain
  Gold Key Chest does not require keys, but 30 Eridium
  Eridium, shield boosters, and other money based item pick ups are auto picked up
  Globally, melee damage is increased
    2x damage from behind
    2x damage from critical hits
    50% more base damage
  Enemy HP/Damage does NOT scale with number of players, but has been increased overall
  Increased enemy spawns by at least 4x.  No cap to number of enemies rendered.
Weapon Part Changes
  Sniper
    Replaces the accuracy accessory of Sniper Rifles. Changes it to slowly regenerate ammo instead of increasing accuracy.
    Comes with custom prefixes: Jakobs = Bountiful, Dahl =Munitional, Hyperion = Rational, Maliwan = Prepared, Vladof = Production.
  Launcher
    Buffed Reload accessory
    Buffed Swap speed accessory
    Accuracy Accessory give ammo regen instead of accuracy
  SMG
    Stability Accessory combined with Accuracy Accessory, Buffed
    Accuracy accessory to Critical chance
    Buff fire rate accessory slightly with a damage buff
    Buff to reload accessory to have larger mag size and more reload speed
  Shotgun
    General buffs to all parts
  Assault Rifle
    Stability and Accuracy combined
    Mag accessory given reload speed
    Accuracy accessory to critical chance
    Bullet speed has small ammo regen
  Pistol
    General buffs to all parts
  All Weapons
    Bayonets take up slot 2 of the accessory portion of a weapon, allowing a different accessory to be used there
  Buffs most shield types (sometimes majorly) to improve overall usability and help specialized or common shields compete with generalized and unique-or-better ones. This mod is designed to be used with Shield Stat Tweaks and requires the Unofficial Community Patch v3.1 or better for Amp shield functionality.
    Redesigns common Amp Shields to constantly regenerate, apply Amp and drain every shot insofar as there's enough shield to drain, and triples common Amp shield Amp damage to help them better compete with The Bee. Please thank LightChaosman for coding the Amp/Drain on every shot behavior.
    Alters all Nova shields' basic stats to fulfill a new design paradigm: rapid depletion, fairly rapid recharge, enormous radius, and high damage for frequent explosions. Explosive novas inherit a larger damage bonus due to not having element matching.
    Increases the damage and recharge rate of Spike shields, reduces recharge delay, and grants them 50% melee resistance to fulfill their intended use easier. Explosive Spike shields inherit a larger portion of damage due to being incapable of element-matching.
    Tweaks absorb shields to have a much higher absorb chance at the expense of taking 20% of damage from absorbed shots instead of no damage. The Sponge and Sham continue to absorb 100% of damage with unchanged absorb chances.
